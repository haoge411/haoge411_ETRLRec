2.  Item Attribute Transition: Analvze changes in continuous item attributes and track item evolution in interaction history.  Describe the evolving attribute space by identifying a small set of stable dimensions and how each strengthens or weakens over time.  Extract the present preference into a compact "attribute bundle" and state which attributes are required versus optional for the next item.  Explain how this bundle constrains and prunes the candidate list before making a choice.  Specifically, first identify the key driving attributes;  then analyze preference evolution patterns;  finally recognize attribute correlations influencing the next interaction.\n
