1. Interaction Sequentiality: Conduct a step-by-step analysis and decomposition of interaction history, withl focus on the chain-like influence between the interacting items.  Not only should analyze influence of past items on future choices, but also the characteristic that recent selected items better reflect current interestl intentions;  at the same time, consider sequential dynamic changes in user interests and interaction patternsl Specifically, history should be modeled as a directed chain, not a set, and divided into clear stages.  Linksl between stages are defined by how items trigger each other.  Early items set expectations that constrainl future choices, while the most recent one or two interactions carry more weight and better reflect currentl intent-sometimes even updating or replacing earlier assumptions.  When a shift happens, we identify thel trigger and the new rule it suggests, then use both the chain structure and recent behavior to predict what kind of item should come next.\n
