There is a reasoning process for sequential recommendation based on the user's movie watching history.\nPlease score this reasoning process (0-1000 points) and make full use of all the provided information:\nThe user's interaction information is as follows: User's interaction history:{interaction_history}\nCandidate item Set:{candidate_item_set}\nThe actual next interaction item (user's actual interaction):{actual_next_item}\nThe SR reasoning process to be scored:<reasoning{output_temporal_reasoning}</reasoning>\nThe corresponding recommendation item of this reasoning:{prediction_next_item}\nThe four scoring standard includes are as follows (note whether there is any hallucination phenomenon):\n1. Is the reasoning of the Interaction Sequentiality of the interaction sequence accurate?\n2. Is the reasoning of the Item Attribute Transition of each item in the interaction sequence accurate?\n3. Is the reasoning of the User Evolving Thought accurate?\n4. Does the predicted next interaction item match the actual next interaction?\nIn addition, you can also use the logits predicted by the Conventional SR Model for each candidate item as an auxiliary to represent the potential recommendation value of each candidate item. The SR model's logits of all candidate items:{SR_Logits}\nPlease provide an objective, evidence-based score based on the scoring standard. The score should clearly differentiate between excellent and insufficient reasoning, with high scores for strong reasoning and low scores for weak reasoning. Ensure the score is accurate and well-considered.\nFormat your response as: <scoring>your score</scoring>
